# Pokemon Wilds - A Gen 2 Pokemon Game/Engine using libGDX

Pokemon Wilds is a Gen 2 Pokemon game/engine built using libGDX. It uses procedural generation to create large worlds with different biomes, each with their own unique pokemon. The levels of wild pokemon increase the further you explore, meaning that some biomes with rare pokemon are difficult to get to. Your Pokemon can help you explore the world by usual means (cut, fly, surf etc), but there are also be new HMs that allow you to interact with the world in new ways, like building structures/houses, jumping up ledges, starting fires, and more.

I have been using a set of techniques to 'rip' sprites and animations from the console game very accurately - as such, the game is intended to look and feel just like the console games, with some extra capabilities (see core/assets/attacks/). The benefit from using libGDX is that the engine can support cross-platform play, multiplayer, huge maps, fullscreen mode, and more pokemon.

In the future I hope that the game can also support graphics from other generations, as well as a map editor mode that could serve as a platform for custom games.

# v0.1
 - Procedurally generated beach, forest, mountain and snow biomes with their own unique pokemon.
 - All Gen 2 Pokemon + Crystal intro animations.
 - Support for the most battle mechanics (wild battle, level up, evolution, attacks, running, catching, etc.)
 - Rips of some attack animations.
 - Building stuff.
 - Multiplayer support.
 - Saving/Loading worlds.
 - Currently desktop and android support only.

# Future aims and goals for the project:
 - Map editor.
 - Support for other platforms (controls, screen resizing).
 - Larger proc-gen worlds with more biomes.
 - Full Gen 2 engine replication (battle mechanics, attacks, etc).
 - Other Generations.

This project is still in the early stages. If you are interested in joining the project, please pm me and we can work out the details of what currently needs done. Loosely, here is the current list:
 - Rips of Gen 2 attack animations
 - Battle system mechanics and animations (trainer battles, status effects, temporary stat changes, etc)
 - Network code for anything added
